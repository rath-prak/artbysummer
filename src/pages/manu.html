                <p class="lead">Bird Nerd provides a dynamic and fun learning experience that will help increase knowledge and awareness of bird conservation in New Zealand.</p>

                <p>In 2014 friends working across the natural resources sector approached me to help come up with visual designs for an app concept they were pitching as part of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.aspiringleaders.org.nz"><strong>Aspiring Leadership Programme</strong></a> (ALP), an annual event that brings together a diverse group of committed and courageous young leaders from across Aotearoa New Zealand.</p>

                <p>Our initial plan was to produce a series of simple wireframes that the team could present, we later felt that wireframes alone were not enough to communicate what the team wanted to build and decided to develop a <span>high fidelity prototype</span> instead which included UI components and interactivity.</p>

                    <h2>Analysis - understanding the user</h2>
                    <p>smartphones are in the pockets of growing numbers of people and tablets are widely available in classrooms. School children, parents, bird enthusiasts, conservationists, scientists, tourists,  tangata whenua, trampers, community groups, Forest & Birders, visitors to wildlife sanctuaries, and NRS agencies will benefit from the innovation of Manu. Feedback received to date from some of Manu’s target audiences indicates a strong demand for this proposed technology (research conducted by Aruns team).

                <h2>Add title - user story or under research or MVP something</h2>
                <p>Because Manu seeks to address many different problems and challenges it would naturally require many different features. For now however I only wanted to include the neccessary features in order to produces a  minimum viable product (MVP). In order to identify the features I wanted in the MVP I created a list of all the potential features for the app and then gave them priority ratings. </p>
                <p>I then derived a feature list for MVP which I then produced a flow cart then used it for producing wireframes. For wifreframes I firstly started off with pen and paper beacuse it was the quickest way to get started then once I was had a good idea I then moved into figma to prodiced hi fidelity wireframes where I could refine them further</p>

                            <p class="lead">For this case study, I decided to focus on developing one user story — registration and login.</p>
                            <p>Wireframing was essential in making sure the prototype started in the right direction. Base on the content provided by the team from ALP, I brainstormed and created sketches using pen and paper. These sketches were done quickly and gave me a good idea of what functionality and content were required for the prototype.</p>
