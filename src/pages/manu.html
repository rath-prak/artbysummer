                <div class="text-divider"></div>
                <p class="lead">New Zealand birds are special - they help define us as a nation.  We have around 68 species of endemic birds, most of which have distinct songs and calls. However, recognising even a few birds from calls is difficult for most people. </p>

                <p>Manu seeks to solve this by bringing people closer to the natural environment through technology, raise awareness of the importance of conservation and introduce this to younger generations by providing a fun and dynamic learning experience.</p>

                <p>Manu also enables crowd-sourcing of data that will increase knowledge and awareness of bird conservation in New Zealand. Each time the app is used to identify a bird, a geotag function will log where each species of bird is recorded. This data will be publicly available through a website enabling individuals, communities, school groups, conservation groups, scientists and government agencies to monitor individual bird species.</p>

                <p><strong>Citizen science will provide meaningful data to aid the conservation effort.</strong></p>

                <h5>Project objectives</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Enable New Zealanders to easily identify NZ bird song/calls</li>
                    <li>Foster greater connection with the natural environment through education and engagement </li>
                    <li>Provide a useful learning tool in both English and Te Reo (kura kaupapa Māori based schools.)</li>
                    <li>Allow citizens to collect meaningful data to help understand more about our native bird species. This may help inform decisions about the management of indigenous fauna.</li>

School children, parents, bird enthusiasts, conservationists, scientists, tourists, tangata whenua, trampers, community groups, Forest & Birders, visitors to wildlife sanctuaries, and NRS agencies will benefit from the innovation of Manu. Feedback received to date from some of Manu’s target audiences indicates a strong demand for this proposed technology.</p>

                <p>Because Manu seeks to address many different problems and challenges it would naturally require many different features. For now however I only wanted to include the neccessary features in order to produces a minimum viable product (MVP). In order to identify these features I created user stories based on my research. I was then able to derive a feature list which I could then use to help user flows and wireframes.</p>

I was able to quickly create a low-fidely prototype using Figma and conduct some usability testing which lead to some new insights, mainly concerning posisioning of elements and additional buttons. After modifications to the inital wireframes I was ready to move on to the UI.
